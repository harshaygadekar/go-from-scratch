To build a go programs whenever we write code:
    > go build main.go
To run  a go program:
    > go run main.go

We can put our source files anywhere like any folder we like.

To run multiple go files: 
    > go run .

Two files can contain different functions and purpose maybe different
but in one folder one of the files should contain main() if multiple files consists
it will result in compile error.

Any folder you choose becomes a package when its .go files start with package main.
But atleast one file should contain func main()

To execute run > go run . inside the package or its own folder.
